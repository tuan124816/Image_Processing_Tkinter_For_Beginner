# Image_Processing_Tkinter_For_Beginner
## Workshop: Image Processing
### Learning Outcomes:
Upon successful completion of this workshop, you will have demonstrated the abilities to:
- Understand the knowledge of point operators, linear filters, nonlinear filters in image processing.
- Write a demo program: Color balance, Histogram equalization, Mean filter, Median filter, Gaussian Smoothing.
## Requirements:
In this exercise, students are asked to write a simple image processing program that has the following basic functions: performing color balance, calculating histogram- performing histogram equalization. Then apply filters like median filter, mean filter, and Gaussian smoothing. Details of the functions are described below:
- Function 1: Color balance, to perform this function, the user needs to enter the necessary parameters to perform color balance. (can use the slider to represent it visually)
- Function 2: Show histogram and enter the necessary information to perform histogram equalization.
- Function 3: Implement the median filter to remove noise in the image(salt and pepper noise)
- Function 4: Implement the Mean filter to remove noise in image (salt and pepper noise)
- Function 5: Implement Gaussian smoothing to perform image smoothing.
## How to use:
- Step 1: Go to file main.py and change the default file path to your file path. Example: subprocess.run(["python", "C:/Users/DELL/Downloads/Workshop2/ColorBalance.py"]) --> subprocess.run(["python", "<your_file_path>/ColorBalance.py"])
- Step 2: Run file main.py (Please note that try to import libraries: tkinter, matplotlib, numpy, opencv-python, pillow)
